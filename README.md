## Semantic HTML Portfolio

Welcome to the Semantic HTML Portfolio Project! For this project, we'll be converting a portfolio created using basic HTML tags (section,article,div etc) to use HTML 5's more semantic tags.
What You'll Learn
We'll use a bunch of HTML 5 elements, including:

1.header
2.footer
3.main
4.nav
5.section
